Fork of Venthure python-ardrone. Updated for python 3.6. The following currenlty works:
* Takeoff, landing and moving the drone around (all demo functions)

Todo:
* Video feed

Getting Started:
----------------

```python
>>> import libardrone
>>> drone = libardrone.ARDrone()
>>> # You might need to call drone.reset() before taking off if the drone is in
>>> # emergency mode
>>> drone.takeoff()
>>> drone.land()
>>> drone.halt()
```

The drone's property `image` contains always the latest image from the camera.
The drone's property `navdata` contains always the latest navdata.


Demo:
-----

There is also a demo application included which shows the video from the drone
and lets you remote-control the drone with the keyboard:

    RETURN      - takeoff
    SPACE       - land
    BACKSPACE   - reset (from emergency)
    a/d         - left/right
    w/s         - forward/back
    1,2,...,0   - speed
    UP/DOWN     - altitude
    LEFT/RIGHT  - turn left/right
